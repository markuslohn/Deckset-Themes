# Deckset-Themes

In this repository you'll find custom themes for [Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com).
Themes customization is still under development, but beta testers are able to play around with those super cool customization!

## How to use

Each theme is in a separate directory, so just go to this directory and you'll find a **Markdown** file (which is a template) with some sample slides, but most importantly, with defined customizations on to of the file.
Besides this, you'll probably find `assets/` directory where all images are stored.
